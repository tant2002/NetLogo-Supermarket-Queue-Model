NetLogo's data driven queue system model of typical supermarket's checkout zone. 

![alt text](/readme-images/model-interface.png)

## WHAT IS IT?
This is a model for simulation queue system of typical supermarket's checkout zone in NetLogo. As opposed to traditional models based on queue theory, it let simulate and examine complex system with non-stationary characteristics i.e.  dynamically changed intensity  of customers arrival,  servers availability and / or service time distribution. 
To mimic process accurately, the model can be driven with historical data (time series)  containing:  intensity of the transactions,  proportions of  transactions for various combination basket sizes/methods of payment  and  cashiers availability (workschedule). It let to examine various checkout zone configurations in terms of quantity and type of servers (service and self-service checkouts) and overview basic performance measures. The model was created with an agent approach (ABS - Agent Based Simulation) however it also meets DES (Discrete Events Simulation)  model definition.  

## HOW IT WORKS
System let to simulate queue system with followed characteristics:  
### customer arrival pattern
Depending on the settings, customer arrival can be simulated as: HPP (Homogenous Poisson Process) or NHPP (None-Homogenous Poisson Process). In first case, inter-arrival rate are sampled according to exponential distribution with given and constant lambda ( = 1 /  arrival rate). In second case intensity function Lambda(t) is designated as an interpolation between the calibration points which are POS (Point of Sale) transactions counts for each hour of available data. Simulation of NHPP is implemented with thinning algorithm.  
### service time pattern
Service time can be sampled according theoretical (exponential) distribution or designated in more complex way in several steps. In the second approach: firstly basket-size of each customer is drawn on the basis of empirical (historical data) or theoretical (Poisson) distribution. Secondly service time  is calculated as the sum of the transaction and break times separately for service and self-service servers (checkouts). The transaction times are compute according to power regression model equation just like the break times for self-service. In this regression model explanatory variable is basket size. The break times for service checkouts â€“ simply randomly sampled. The parameters for this models was estimated according to historical data out of grocery supermarkets located in a large city in Southern Poland and are hardcoded within procedures 'customer-server-service-time-draw-regression' and customer-sco-server-service-time-draw-regression'     
### number of available servers
The number of servers (both service and self-service) is given as parameters. However the availability of servers depends - like in real supermarket -  on number of  cashiers present in store. The latter is dependent on workschedule (historical data) and planned work time given as parameter. Because in real environments, cashiers can perform other than checkout tasks in periods of low traffic, the a mechanism for leaving the checkouts and entering the backoffice zone has been implemented. Cashier is trigger: to close or to open checkout when the mean queue length fall below or exceed given thresholds respectively. It is also assumed that changeover from backoffice to checkout of cashier takes time (set as parameter). 
### queue discipline
First In First Served (FIFS) for both types of server. 
### number of queues
The system can mimic both multi or single queue to the service checkouts. For self-service checkouts, only single queue is possible. 
Since the system assumes multiple queues, various methods of queue picking have been implemented. Although the way of picking is an individual decision of each client, the model assumes that each cashier uses the same strategy. It is possible to simulate 5 different strategies (0 - 4) that reflect different levels of customer knowledge about the state of the system: from strategy 0 that reflect no information (pure random choice of queue) to strategy 4 which assumes ability to estimate expected waiting times in each queue (= queue with minimum expected waiting time is picked). Strategies 0 - 3  are between - see description of 'customer-picking-queue-strategy' parameter for more details.          
### customer's jockeying
Model can mimic jockeying of customers between the queues. The rule of jockeyng is implemented to be depend on 3 values. First parameter (strategy) decide whenever the customer is able to jockey or not, second parameter - distance -  decide abbout distance (between lines) within the customer is able to jockey and third parameter threshold decide about minimal difrence between current posiont of customer in queue and lenght of queue to jockeying.   

Historical time series can extracted out of transactional data that are collected by most of POS (Point of Sale) system -  see work "Data-driven simulation modelling of the checkout process in supermarkets: Insights for decision support in retail operations" for more details.

## HOW TO USE IT
The main code of the model can be found in main directory in file SupermarketQueueModel_version_x_x.nlogo.  
The model use two Netlogo extensions that need to be lto be installed in local environment of NetLogo.
 - Time extension ( see https://github.com/NetLogo/Time-Extension ). 
 - The RNGS extension (see https://github.com/cstaelin/RNGS-Extension).
Instruction for extensions in NetLogo can be find on http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/extensions.html.
Due to exc installations, the model can only be launched in the local netlogo environment (no possible to use Netlogo Web)  
Depend on user decision, the model can be run with mode that use POS (Point of Sale) historical data or with inputs generated randomly according to theoretical distributions. To drive model with POS data  the values, parameters "customer-arrival-process", "customer-basket-payment", "cashier-arrival", 'server-service-time-model' and 'sco-server-service-time-model' need to be set on relevant values (see section Parameters bellow) and input files (see section POS data input files) need to be provide. 

### POS data input files
As example, the files contained historical data generated out POS  transactional data from supermarket located in southern Poland was provided. However,  it is possible to use any data. Please note data range of all files need to be coherent. Files are in time series format and need NetLogo Time extension ( see https://github.com/NetLogo/Time-Extension ). The path to each file need to be indicated as parameter. 
#### [customer-arrival-input-file-store1.csv](customer-arrival-input-file-store1.csv)
This file contain data that are necessary to generate arrivals of customers to checkouts in supermarket. It's assumed that arrivals of customers Non Homogenous Poisson Process (NHPP) and expected value of arrived customers in each hour is close to number of transaction in each hour. In the model expected value of arrivals (lambda function in NHPP) is equal to the linear interpolation between calibration points. The calibration points are number of transaction (transactions count) for each hour .  The data in file contains following fields (columns):
"timestamp" = full hour +/- 30 min , "customer-transaction-count" = number of transactions within time window <full hour, full hour + 1>.  
#### [customer-basket-payment-input-file-store1.csv](customer-basket-payment-input-file-store1.csv)
This file contain data which are necessary to sample basket size and method of payment of customers.  Although the drawing of the payment method does not  affect currently on the model, it can be used for future extensions. The structure of file is as follow:
"timestamp" = full hour  , the rest of fields contain count of transactions for each basket size (articles in transaction ) and method of payment within time window <full hour, full hour + 1>. Names of this fields are decoded as follow:   0 + basket size,  for method of payment cash , 1000 + basket size for non-cash methods of payment: "1"
,"2", "3", ...,"1001, "1002", "1003"... .
#### [cashier-arrival-input-file-store1.csv](cashier-arrival-input-file-store1.csv)
This file contains workschedule of cashiers. It determines number of cashiers that arrive to work in each full-hour of simulation. This file specifies only the time of cashiers arrivals. The length of shifts (time cashiers spent in store) is determined by parameter 'cashier-work-time' (see description below). The structure of the file is as follow: "timestamp" = time of cashier's arrival to store, "number-of-cashiers" = number of cashiers that arrive to store on this time.

#### customer-cash-payment-rate
See description of "customer-basket-payment" parameter 
#### customer-picking-queue-strategy
It determine the strategy of picking line by the customer. Followed possibility are available: 0 the line is picked randomly, using a uniform distribution; 1 - the line with the lowest number of customers is picked, 2 - the line with the lowest number of items in all baskets in this line is picked; 3 the line with the lowest mean service time-implied expected waiting time is picked, i.e. the expected waiting time for each queue is calculated using the number of customers and the mean service time for service and self-service checkouts; 4 the line with the lowest power regression-implied expected waiting time is picked, i.e., the expected waiting time for each queue is calculated using the number of customers and the expected service and break times.
Value 99  means that will be sampled out of 0 - 4 according to uniform distribution for every agent customer separately.
#### customer-sco-item-threshold
The parameter determine whenever customer can or cannot use sco-servers. Customers with basket size that exceed the value of the parameter are referred to the service checkouts (servers). Only if none of service checkout is open,  customers with basket size that exceed thershold are referred to sco-servers. This parameter let to simulate i.e. "expres self-service checkouts" scenarios.     
#### customer-jockeying-strategy
It determine the strategy of jockeying by customer. Followed possibility are available: 0 - customer does not jockey in any case, 1 - customer jockey if  his  position in line exceeds the line length that is within jockeying distance by the jockeying threshold. Value 99 means that strategy 1 or 2 will sampled ccording to uniform distribution for every agent customer separately.
#### customer-jockeying-distance  
It determines the distance (between lines on both side) in which the customer is willing to jockey. Please note that parameter distance-server-server determine the distance between lines. So the jockeying distance must take account of the distance between lines. In other words this parameters must reflect differences between coordinates of servers. 
Possible value is 1 2 3 4. Value 99 means that distance will be sampled out of 1 - 4 according to uniform distribution for every agent customer separately. 
####  customer-jockeying-threshold

#### cashier-min-line 
This parameter determine behaviour of cashiers in the system. In case average queue length in store is less than this value, the cashier close checkout (server). Note, that  cashier will remain in checkout until last customer from current queue will be served. Closed checkout means no new customer can join to the queue assign to checkout. 
#### cashier-return-time
Value in minutes (ticks). This parameter determine time the cashier need to switch from backoffice to checkout. In other words: it takes "cashier-return-time"  minutes to go from backoffice to checkout and open it.

### Aggregated statistics
#### for customers 
![alt text](/readme-images/outputs-customers.png) 

Statistics shows 'number of customers', 'percentage of customers', 'mean queue (waiting) time', mean queue time (only for customers that need to wait) and rate of customers that have to wait more than 5 minutes (ticks). Data are presented for all customers and with distinction for service (servers) self-service (sco-server) checkouts.    
#### for cashiers
![alt text](/readme-images/outputs-cashiers.png) 

Statistics show: 'total time' (means sum of time that each cashier spent in system), 'total time on server' (means sum of time each cashier was on server), 'changeovers' (number of times all cashiers shift between servers and backoffice), 'total working time' (sum of 'time on server' and multiplication of 'changeovers' and value of 'cashier-return-time') and 'utilization' (ratio of 'total working time' and  'total time')     

#### for servers
![alt text](/readme-images/outputs-servers.png) 

'total time' is multiplication of simulation time and number of servers/ sco-servers. 'service time' is sum of times of serving customers on servers/ sco-servers.  'utilization' is ratio of 'service time' and  'total time'.

## THINGS TO TRY
### Simple M/M/1 model
If only one server is set in  system and theoretical (exponential) distribution of customer and service time is set, then it is simple M/M/1 queue model. A simulation of a sufficiently long period of time should cause the 'mean queue time' statistic to aim for theoretical values calculated using a formula known from queue theory. 
### Historical data driven experiments 
Base of historical data it is possible to mimic queues in  checkout zone of real supermarket.
#### Picking queue strategy
Try various picking line strategy to see how proper referral of customers to pick 'right' queue can affect on performance of system measured by waiting time or/and  utilization of cashiers. 
#### Servers / SCO-servers configuration variants
By change the configuration of system (quantity of various types of servers) it is possible to check the impact various investments variants on work demand (utilization of cashiers).
